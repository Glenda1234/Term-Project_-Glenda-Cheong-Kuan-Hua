<h2><li>Kirby</li></h2>
<p>Kirby is the main protagonist of the Kirby series of video games owned by Nintendo. He first appeared in Kirby's Dream Land (1992), a platform game, for the Game Boy. Originally a placeholder, created by Japanese video game designer Masahiro Sakurai, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball, and has been featured as a playable character in every installment of the Super Smash Bros. series. He has also starred in his own anime and manga series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko Ohmoto.

    Kirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their powers, as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare. On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and Meta Knight, though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by PC World. In virtually all his appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving; however, he becomes fearless, bold and clever in the face of danger.</p>
